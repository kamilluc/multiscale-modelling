# Multiscale Modeling Project\

srx
2 different types 
homogeneus(same value of eneregy for every cell(from gui))
same color -> after sim 2nd color (0 energy)
/
hetergeneus
find all cells set one value of h to inner grains and another h for cells on boundaries
more energy on boundaries => faster growth on boundaries



h wewnetrza zmienna kazdej komorki
2 states recyrysall yes/no


po symulacji cala energia =0

nucelation over tame like add 10 nucleons in first iteration 10 next in 10th iteration etc

before checking energy atleast one neighbour shoul be already recrystalized

formula for calc energy like MC but +H (only energy before)
energy =0 
state = some another color
recrystalized = true


//todays classes
add 2nd view
